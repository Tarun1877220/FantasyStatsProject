# Our Question:
Are fantasy football points an indicator for a team’s playoff success in the NFL?


# Background:
Fantasy football is an online game that tracks real life players and awards them points based on performance during the NFL regular season
Many treat fantasy football results very seriously, bringing up the question of whether fantasy football can predict real life performance of a team 
This topic has two halves — the game (fantasy football) and reality (playoff results) — and we’re using the two to help visualize correlation from fantasy points to real world result

# Our Proposal:
We plan to answer our question by determining how probable it is for a team to succeed in the playoffs based on the team’s fantasy football performance

# Conclusion:

- We are least likely to be able to predict the winner of the super bowl given WR fantasy points for a team, as the winner of the super bowl lies in or above the 45th percentile of WR fantasy points. 
- QB, RB, and team fantasy values, on the other hand, are much more focused for super bowl winners, as the winners have point values, on average, that lie in the 90th percentile or higher for these positions, creating a better indicator for super bowl winner. 
- There is strong evidence of a negative linear relationship between the fantasy points earned by each position (other than WR) and the playoff ranking demonstrating that QB, RB, and Team points are viable methods of predicting to a certain extent
